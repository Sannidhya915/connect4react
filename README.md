I built a Connect4 game with ReactJS!

Check it out here: https://s915-connect4react.netlify.app/

It's a simple HTML5 game that requires players to connect four of their circles vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in order to win. It also has a CPU player that makes a move if the "Suggest" button is clicked.

Let me know what you think of the game! I'm always looking for feedback.
